Rather than create more rspec features in this folder (/spec/features), please instead consider writing your tests as
behaviour-driven cucumber tests (in /features).

At a high level, cucumber tests are more readable than rspecs. This is particularly important when the feature to be
tested involves several different parts of the system.

For a quick introduction to writing cucumber tests, see:

See also the Create Dataset example feature in /features/create_dataset.feature
